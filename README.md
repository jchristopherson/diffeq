# diffeq
A modern Fortran library providing an object-oriented approach to solving ordinary differential equations and related analyses.

## Work-In-Progress
This library is currently a work-in-progress.  The API is definitely not in a stable condition.

## Build Status
[![CMake](https://github.com/jchristopherson/diffeq/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jchristopherson/diffeq/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

## Documentation
The documentation can be found [here](https://jchristopherson.github.io/diffeq/).

## Available ODE Solvers
### Fixed Step
- 4th Order Runge-Kutta
- Adams-Bashforth-Moulton

### Variable Step
- Dormand-Prince Runge-Kutta 5th/4th Order
- Bogacki-Shampine Runge-Kutta 3rd/2nd Order
- 4th Order Singly Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta

## Additional Operations
- FFT-Based Frequency Response Function Estimation
- Frequency-Sweep-Based Frequency Response Function Estimation
